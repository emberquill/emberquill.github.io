I&rsquo;ve started this blog mostly because I wanted to talk about my current personal project, which I started solely because I was playing an old and very poorly-documented Pokemon Emerald ROM hack and wanted to dig into its internal data to figure out where different Pokemon spawn and what other changes were made. This is my first foray into ROM hacking and it has definitely been an educational experience, so I thought it would be worth writing up what I&rsquo;ve done and posting it somewhere for others to read, since the ROM data structure isn&rsquo;t extremely well-documented.</p></div></article></main></body></html>
