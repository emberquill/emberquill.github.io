Back in mid-2020, I decided to set up a blog. I set up a GitHub Pages site, a build pipeline to generate my static site with Hugo, and wrote my first post. And then I never updated my blog again, and eventually deleted it outright. But now I&amp;rsquo;m making another attempt.
But why? I want to talk about stuff. Seriously, that&amp;rsquo;s it. I started a bigger-than-anticipated project involving Pokemon GBA ROM hacking (more on that in a future post) and realized that I really wanted to talk about what I was doing and the headaches I ran into trying to decipher the data structures in a Pokemon Emerald cartridge dump.</description></item></channel></rss>
