Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Pokemon ROM hacking.
First, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what a ROM hack is, basically it&amp;rsquo;s just a modified or &amp;ldquo;hacked&amp;rdquo; game. Not necessarily for the sake of cheating, though, which is what usually comes to mind when someone talks about hacked games. In fact, many ROM hacks are significantly more difficult than the original games they&amp;rsquo;re based on. ROM hacks exist for many reasons, but that&amp;rsquo;s not really the point of this post so if you really want to learn more, Bulbapedia has a great article on the subject.</description></item></channel></rss>
